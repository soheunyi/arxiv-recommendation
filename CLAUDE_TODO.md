 - [x] Debug (500 error)
 - [x] Automatic paper collection every morning
 - [x] Automatic update of scores every day (requires recomputing user preference embedding and scoring all papers -- use cached embeddings)
     - [x] Should implement a collection logic to only look for recent papers.
 - [x] One problem is that the user preference embedding does not reflect the user's "recent" preferences. There should be a logic to keep track of the user's recent preferences and update the embedding accordingly --- maybe "all time" embedding and "recent" embedding?
     - [x] Maybe we can think of weighting the "recent" embedding by the user's recent preferences? EMA style?
 - [x] Implement a HARD logic for collecting papers to avoid sending multiple requests to openai API.
 - [x] Use cached embeddings for scoring papers.


- Reference tracking algorithm: (1) parse html to get references (2) google each paper and cross-validate arxiv id (3) fetch with arxiv api
