    "title": "Deep Learning in Single-Cell Analysis",
    "abstract": "Single-cell technologies are revolutionizing the entire field of biology. The large volumes of data generated by single-cell technologies are high-dimensional, sparse, heterogeneous, and have complicated dependency structures, making analyses using conventional machine learning approaches challenging and impractical. In tackling these challenges, deep learning often demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional machine learning methods. In this work, we give a comprehensive survey on deep learning in single-cell analysis. We first introduce background on single-cell technologies and their development, as well as fundamental concepts of deep learning including the most popular deep architectures. We present an overview of the single-cell analytic pipeline pursued in research applications while noting divergences due to data sources or specific applications. We then review seven popular tasks spanning through different stages of the single-cell analysis pipeline, including multimodal integration, imputation, clustering, spatial domain identification, cell-type deconvolution, cell segmentation, and cell-type annotation. Under each task, we describe the most recent developments in classical and deep learning methods and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Deep learning tools and benchmark datasets are also summarized for each task. Finally, we discuss the future directions and the most recent challenges. This survey will serve as a reference for biologists and computer scientists, encouraging collaborations.",

    "abstract": "Confocal Raman microscopy offers a particular pathway for monitoring chemical \"fingerprints\" of intracellular components like the cell membrane, organelles, and nucleus. Nevertheless, conventional Raman acquisitions of fixed or randomly dispersed cells on a substrate, such as a microscope slide, might be severely limited for biomedical investigations. Backscattered Raman signal is likely to be overshadowed by contributions from substrate fluorescence. Also, biological assays for drug discovery, infection, and tissue engineering may require monitoring live cells individually over a time interval spanning from a few hours to a few days. To meet the needs of cell assay monitoring, we propose an acoustofluidic device that forms a levitating cell aggregation (one layer) in a cylindrical chamber of 10 {\\mu}L volume that operates at 1 MHz frequency. The integrated system comprises a lab-on-a-chip device and a confocal Raman microscope. In this setup, a cell can be selectively Raman-investigated with micrometre accuracy, without any substrate interference. Based on a set of carefully designed experiments, we demonstrate that polystyrene microparticles are assembled and held standstill, enabling a full Raman spectrum to be taken of a single particle in less than a minute. The signal-to-background ratio is improved by a thousandfold when compared with conventional Raman acquisition. The Raman-acoustofluidic system is showcased for obtaining the spectrum of a single cell among an enriched population of macrophages of mice. The obtained results confirm the method's robustness for applications in single-cell analysis.",

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly evolve, their influence in science is becoming increasingly prominent. The emerging capabilities of LLMs in task generalization and free-form dialogue can significantly advance fields like chemistry and biology. However, the field of single-cell biology, which forms the foundational building blocks of living organisms, still faces several challenges. High knowledge barriers and limited scalability in current methods restrict the full exploitation of LLMs in mastering single-cell data, impeding direct accessibility and rapid iteration. To this end, we introduce ChatCell, which signifies a paradigm shift by facilitating single-cell analysis with natural language. Leveraging vocabulary adaptation and unified sequence generation, ChatCell has acquired profound expertise in single-cell biology and the capability to accommodate a diverse range of analysis tasks. Extensive experiments further demonstrate ChatCell's robust performance and potential to deepen single-cell insights, paving the way for more accessible and intuitive exploration in this pivotal field.

    "abstract": "To maintain a constant cell size, dividing cells have to coordinate cell cycle events with cell growth. This coordination has for long been supposed to rely on the existence of size thresholds determining cell cycle progression [1]. In budding yeast, size is controlled at the G1/S transition [11]. In agreement with this hypothesis, the size at birth influences the time spent in G1: smaller cells have a longer G1 period [3]. Nevertheless, even though cells born smaller have a longer G1, the compensation is imperfect and they still bud at smaller cell sizes. In bacteria, several recent studies have shown that the incremental model of size control, in which size is controlled by addition of a constant volume (in contrast to a size threshold), is able to quantitatively explain the experimental data on 4 different bacterial species [6, 5, 6, 7]. Here, we report on experimental results for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, finding, surprisingly, that cell size control in this organism is very well described by the incremental model, suggesting a common strategy for cell size control with bacteria. Additionally, we argue that for S. cerevisiae the volume increment is not added from birth to division, but rather between two budding events.",

With the growth of single-cell profiling technologies, there has also been a significant increase in data collected from single-cell profilings, resulting in computational challenges to process these massive and complicated datasets. To address these challenges, deep learning (DL) is positioning as a competitive alternative for single-cell analyses besides the traditional machine learning approaches. Here we present a processing pipeline of single-cell RNA-seq data, survey a total of 25 DL algorithms and their applicability for a specific step in the processing pipeline. Specifically, we establish a unified mathematical representation of all variational autoencoder, autoencoder, and generative adversarial network models, compare the training strategies and loss functions for these models, and relate the loss functions of these models to specific objectives of the data processing step. Such presentation will allow readers to choose suitable algorithms for their particular objective at each step in the pipeline. We envision that this survey will serve as an important information portal for learning the application of DL for scRNA-seq analysis and inspire innovative use of DL to address a broader range of new challenges in emerging multi-omics and spatial single-cell sequencing.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for multi-object microbial cell segmentation. The approach combines an ML-based detection with a geometry-aware variational-based segmentation using B-splines that are parametrized based on a geometric model of the cell shape. The detection is done first using YOLOv5. In a second step, each detected cell is segmented individually. Thus, the segmentation only needs to be done on a per-cell basis, which makes it amenable to a variational approach that incorporates prior knowledge on the geometry. Here, the contour of the segmentation is modelled as closed uniform cubic B-spline, whose control points are parametrized using the known cell geometry. Compared to purely ML-based segmentation approaches, which need accurate segmentation maps as training data that are very laborious to produce, our method just needs bounding boxes as training data. Still, the proposed method performs on par with ML-based segmentation approaches usually used in this context. We study the performance of the proposed method on time-lapse microscopy data of Corynebacterium glutamicum.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, single cell RNA sequencing has become a widely used technique to study cellular diversity and function. However, accurately annotating cell types from single cell data has been a challenging task, as it requires extensive knowledge of cell biology and gene function. The emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT and New Bing in 2023 has revolutionized this process by integrating the scientific literature and providing accurate annotations of cell types. This breakthrough enables researchers to conduct literature reviews more efficiently and accurately, and can potentially uncover new insights into cell type annotation. By using ChatGPT to annotate single cell data, we can relate rare cell type to their function and reveal specific differentiation trajectories of cell subtypes that were previously overlooked. This can have important applications in understanding cancer progression, mammalian development, and stem cell differentiation, and can potentially lead to the discovery of key cells that interrupt the differentiation pathway and solve key problems in the life sciences. Overall, the future of cell type annotation in single cell data looks promising and the Large Language model will be an important milestone in the history of single cell analysis.",

Building on this, we develop a multi-modal cell language architecture capable of simultaneously interpreting and processing both modalities. InstructCell empowers researchers to accomplish critical tasks-such as cell type annotation, conditional pseudo-cell generation, and drug sensitivity prediction-using straightforward natural language commands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that InstructCell consistently meets or exceeds the performance of existing single-cell foundation models, while adapting to diverse experimental conditions.

We identified transition genes such as DKK3, NOTCH2, GATAD1, GFAP, and SEZ6L in IDHWT glioblastoma, and H3F3A, ANXA6, HES6/7, SIRT2, FXYD6, PTPRZ1, MEIS1, CXXC5, and NDUFAB1 in K27M subtypes. We also identified MTRNR2L1, GAPDH, IGF2, FKBP variants, and FXYD7 as transition genes that influence cell fate decision-making across both subsystems. Our findings suggest pHGGs are developmentally trapped in states exhibiting maladaptive behaviors, and hybrid cellular identities. In effect, tumor heterogeneity (metastability) and plasticity emerge as stress-response patterns to immune-inflammatory microenvironments and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we show that pHGGs are steered by developmental trajectories from radial glia predominantly favoring neocortical cell fates, in telencephalon and prefrontal cortex (PFC) differentiation. By addressing underlying patterning processes and plasticity networks as therapeutic vulnerabilities, our findings provide precision medicine strategies aimed at modulating glioma cell fates and overcoming therapeutic resistance. We suggest transition therapy toward neuronal-like lineage differentiation as a potential therapy to help stabilize pHGG plasticity and aggressivity.",

Due to growing amounts of data generated and the increasing complexity of the computational protocols needed to process the resulting datasets, the demand for dedicated training in mathematical and programming skills may preclude the use of these powerful techniques by many teams.   In order to help close that gap between wet-lab and dry-lab capabilities we have developed SinglePointRNA, a shiny-based R application that provides a graphic interface for different publicly available tools to analyze single cell RNA-seq data.   The aim of SinglePointRNA is to provide an accessible and transparent tool set to researchers that allows them to perform detailed and custom analysis of their data autonomously. SinglePointRNA is structured in a context-driven framework that prioritizes providing the user with solid qualitative guidance at each step of the analysis process and interpretation of the results. Additionally, the rich user guides accompanying the software are intended to serve as a point of entry for users to learn more about computational techniques applied to single cell data analysis.

In the last decade, it has been applied to various fields, including cancer biology, neuroscience, and, especially, developmental biology. This rise in popularity has been accompanied with creation of modern software, development of new pipelines and design of new algorithms. Many established algorithms have also been applied with varying levels of effectiveness. Currently, there is an abundance of algorithms for all steps of the general workflow. While some scientists use ready-made pipelines (such as Seurat), manual analysis is popular, too, as it allows more flexibility. Scientists who perform their own analysis face multiple options when it comes to the choice of algorithms. We have used two different datasets to test some of the most widely-used algorithms. In this paper, we are going to report the main differences between them, suggest a minimal number of algorithms for each step, and explain our suggestions. In certain stages, it is impossible to make a clear choice without further context. In these cases, we are going to explore the major possibilities, and make suggestions for each one of them.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships, thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training. However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers, specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is always the optimum choice.",

Recent deep learning models like Geneformer and Mouse-Geneformer perform well on tasks such as cell-type classification and in silico perturbation. However, their species-specific design limits cross-species generalization and translational applications, which are crucial for advancing translational research and drug discovery. We present Mix-Geneformer, a novel Transformer-based model that integrates human and mouse scRNA-seq data into a unified representation via a hybrid self-supervised approach combining Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and SimCSE-based contrastive loss to capture both shared and species-specific gene patterns. A rank-value encoding scheme further emphasizes high-variance gene signals during training. Trained on about 50 million cells from diverse human and mouse organs, Mix-Geneformer matched or outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type classification and in silico perturbation tasks, achieving 95.8% accuracy on mouse kidney data versus 94.9% from the best existing model. It also successfully identified key regulatory genes validated by in vivo studies. By enabling scalable cross-species transcriptomic modeling, Mix-Geneformer offers a powerful tool for comparative transcriptomics and translational applications.

    "abstract": "Cell type identification from single-cell transcriptomic data is a common goal of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data analysis. Neural networks have been employed to identify cell types from scRNAseq data with high performance. However, it requires a large mount of individual cells with accurate and unbiased annotated types to build the identification models. Unfortunately, labeling the scRNAseq data is cumbersome and time-consuming as it involves manual inspection of marker genes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised learning model to use unlabeled scRNAseq cells and limited amount of labeled scRNAseq cells to implement cell identification. Firstly, we transform the scRNAseq cells to \"gene sentences\", which is inspired by similarities between natural language system and gene system. Then genes in these sentences are represented as gene embeddings to reduce data sparsity. With these embeddings, we implement a semi-supervised learning model based on recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNN), which includes a shared network, a supervised network and an unsupervised network. The proposed model is evaluated on macosko2015, a large scale single-cell transcriptomic dataset with ground truth of individual cell types. It is observed that the proposed model is able to achieve encouraging performance by learning on very limited amount of labeled scRNAseq cells together with a large number of unlabeled scRNAseq cells.",

We consider a frequent setting where both labeled and unlabeled data are available at training time, but the sets of the labels of labeled data on one side and of the unlabeled data on the other side, are disjoint. It is an instance of the Novel Class Discovery problem. The goal is to achieve two objectives, clustering the data and mapping the clusters with labels.

We review seventeen software packages that are available today for the cell cycle analysis using scRNA-seq data. Despite huge progress achieved, none of the packages can produce complete and reliable results with respect to all aforementioned tasks. One of the major difficulties for existing packages is distinguishing between two patterns of cell cycle transcriptomic dynamics: normal and characteristic for embryonic stem cells (ESC), with the latter one shared by many cancer cell lines. Moreover, some cell lines are characterized by a mixture of two subpopulations, one following the standard and one ESC-like cell cycle, which makes the analysis even more challenging. In conclusion, we discuss the difficulties of the analysis of cell cycle-related single cell transcriptome and provide certain guidelines for the use of the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: With the development of droplet based systems, massive single cell transcriptome data has become available, which enables analysis of cellular and molecular processes at single cell resolution and is instrumental to understanding many biological processes. While state-of-the-art clustering methods have been applied to the data, they face challenges in the following aspects: (1) the clustering quality still needs to be improved; (2) most models need prior knowledge on number of clusters, which is not always available; (3) there is a demand for faster computational speed. Results: We propose to tackle these challenges with Parallel Split Merge Sampling on Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (the Para-DPMM model). Unlike classic DPMM methods that perform sampling on each single data point, the split merge mechanism samples on the cluster level, which significantly improves convergence and optimality of the result. The model is highly parallelized and can utilize the computing power of high performance computing (HPC) clusters, enabling massive clustering on huge datasets. Experiment results show the model outperforms current widely used models in both clustering quality and computational speed.

Present computational approaches predominantly investigate the local and first-order structures of scRNA-seq data using graph representations, while scRNA-seq data frequently displays complex high-dimensional structures. Here, we present a tool, scGeom for exploiting the multiscale and multidimensional structures in scRNA-seq data by inspecting the geometry via graph curvature and topology via persistent homology of both cell networks and gene networks.

    "abstract": "Understanding cell identity and function through single-cell level sequencing data remains a key challenge in computational biology. We present a novel framework that leverages gene-specific textual annotations from the NCBI Gene database to generate biologically contextualized cell embeddings. For each cell in a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, we rank genes by expression level, retrieve their NCBI Gene descriptions, and transform these descriptions into vector embedding representations using large language models (LLMs). The models used include OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, and text-embedding-3-large (Jan 2024), as well as domain-specific models BioBERT and SciBERT. Embeddings are computed via an expression-weighted average across the top N most highly expressed genes in each cell, providing a compact, semantically rich representation. This multimodal strategy bridges structured biological data with state-of-the-art language modeling, enabling more interpretable downstream applications such as cell-type clustering, cell vulnerability dissection, and trajectory inference.",

    "abstract": "Single-Cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measurements have facilitated genome-scale transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, with the hope of deconvolving cellular dynamic changes in corresponding cell sub-populations to better understand molecular mechanisms of different development processes. Several scRNA-seq analysis methods have been proposed to first identify cell sub-populations by clustering and then separately perform differential expression analysis to understand gene expression changes. Their corresponding statistical models and inference algorithms are often designed disjointly. We develop a new method -- SimCD -- that explicitly models cell heterogeneity and dynamic differential changes in one unified hierarchical gamma-negative binomial (hGNB) model, allowing simultaneous cell clustering and differential expression analysis for scRNA-seq data. Our method naturally defines cell heterogeneity by dynamic expression changes, which is expected to help achieve better performances on the two tasks compared to the existing methods that perform them separately. In addition, SimCD better models dropout (zero inflation) in scRNA-seq data by both cell- and gene-level factors and obviates the need for sophisticated pre-processing steps such as normalization, thanks to the direct modeling of scRNA-seq count data by the rigorous hGNB model with an efficient Gibbs sampling inference algorithm. Extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real-world scRNA-seq count data demonstrate the capability of SimCD to discover cell clusters and capture dynamic expression changes. Furthermore, SimCD helps identify several known genes affected by food deprivation in hypothalamic neuron cell subtypes as well as some new potential markers, suggesting the capability of SimCD for bio-marker discovery.",

    "abstract": "Background: Understanding cellular diversity throughout the body is essential for elucidating the complex functions of biological systems. Recently, large-scale single-cell omics datasets, known as omics atlases, have become available. These atlases encompass data from diverse tissues and cell-types, providing insights into the landscape of cell-type-specific gene expression. However, the isolated effect of the tissue environment has not been thoroughly investigated. Evaluating this isolated effect is challenging due to statistical confounding with cell-type effects, arising from significant biases in the combinations of tissues and cell-types within the body. Results: This study introduces a novel data analysis framework, named the Combinatorial Sub-dataset Extraction for Confounding Reduction (COSER), which addresses statistical confounding by using graph theory to enumerate appropriate sub-datasets. COSER enables the assessment of isolated effects of discrete variables in single cells. Applying COSER to the Tabula Muris Senis single-cell transcriptome atlas, we characterized the isolated impact of tissue environments. Our findings demonstrate that some of genes are markedly affected by the tissue environment, particularly in modulating intercellular diversity in immune responses and their age-related changes. Conclusion: COSER provides a robust, general-purpose framework for evaluating the isolated effects of discrete variables from large-scale data mining. This approach reveals critical insights into the interplay between tissue environments and gene expression.",

    "abstract": "scRNA-seq data has the potential to provide new insights into cellular heterogeneity and data acquisition; however, a major challenge is unraveling confounding from technical and biological batch effects. Existing batch correction algorithms suppress and discard these effects, rather than quantifying and modeling them. Here, we present scMEDAL, a framework for single-cell Mixed Effects Deep Autoencoder Learning, which separately models batch-invariant and batch-specific effects using two complementary autoencoder networks. One network is trained through adversarial learning to capture a batch-invariant representation, while a Bayesian autoencoder learns a batch-specific representation. Comprehensive evaluations spanning conditions (e.g., autism, leukemia, and cardiovascular), cell types, and technical and biological effects demonstrate that scMEDAL suppresses batch effects while modeling batch-specific variation, enhancing accuracy and interpretability. Unlike prior approaches, the framework's fixed- and random-effects autoencoders enable retrospective analyses, including predicting a cell's expression as if it had been acquired in a different batch via genomap projections at the cellular level, revealing the impact of biological (e.g., diagnosis) and technical (e.g., acquisition) effects. By combining scMEDAL's batch-agnostic and batch-specific latent spaces, it enables more accurate predictions of disease status, donor group, and cell type, making scMEDAL a valuable framework for gaining deeper insight into data acquisition and cellular heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Antigen-specific T cells play an essential role in immunoregulation and diseases such as cancer. Characterizing the T cell receptor (TCR) sequences that encode T cell specificity is critical for elucidating the antigenic determinants of immunological diseases and designing therapeutic remedies. However, methods of obtaining single-cell TCR sequencing data are labor and cost intensive, requiring cell sorting and full length single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). New high-throughput 3' cell-barcoding scRNA-seq methods can simplify and scale this process; however, they do not routinely capture TCR sequences during library preparation and sequencing. While 5' cell-barcoding scRNA-seq methods can be used to examine TCR repertoire at single-cell resolution, it requires specialized reagents which cannot be applied to samples previously processed using 3' cell-barcoding methods. Here, we outline a method for sequencing TCR$\\alpha$ and TCR$\\beta$ transcripts from samples already processed using 3' cell-barcoding scRNA-seq platforms, ensuring TCR recovery at a single-cell resolution. In short, a fraction of the 3' barcoded whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) product typically used to generate a massively parallel 3' scRNA-seq library is enriched for TCR transcripts using biotinylated probes, and further amplified using the same universal primer sequence from WTA. Primer extension using TCR V-region primers and targeted PCR amplification results in a 3' barcoded single-cell CDR3-enriched library that can be sequenced with custom sequencing primers. Coupled with 3' scRNA-seq of the same WTA, this method enables simultaneous analysis of single-cell transcriptomes and TCR sequences which can help interpret inherent heterogeneity among antigen-specific T cells and salient disease biology. This method can be adapted to enrich other transcripts of interest from 3' and 5' barcoded WTA libraries.",

However, scaling high-throughput screens (HTSs) to measure cellular responses for many drugs remains a challenge due to technical limitations and, more importantly, the cost of such multiplexed experiments. Thus, transferring information from routinely performed bulk RNA HTS is required to enrich single-cell data meaningfully. We introduce chemCPA, a new encoder-decoder architecture to study the perturbational effects of unseen drugs. We combine the model with an architecture surgery for transfer learning and demonstrate how training on existing bulk RNA HTS datasets can improve generalisation performance. Better generalisation reduces the need for extensive and costly screens at single-cell resolution.

We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.",

    "abstract": "To understand the function of cortical circuits it is necessary to classify their underlying cellular diversity. Traditional attempts based on comparing anatomical or physiological features of neurons and glia, while productive, have not resulted in a unified taxonomy of neural cell types. The recent development of single-cell transcriptomics has enabled, for the first time, systematic high-throughput profiling of large numbers of cortical cells and the generation of datasets that hold the promise of being complete, accurate and permanent. Statistical analyses of these data have revealed the existence of clear clusters, many of which correspond to cell types defined by traditional criteria, and which are conserved across cortical areas and species. To capitalize on these innovations and advance the field, we, the Copenhagen Convention Group, propose the community adopts a transcriptome-based taxonomy of the cell types in the adult mammalian neocortex. This core classification should be ontological, hierarchical and use a standardized nomenclature. It should be configured to flexibly incorporate new data from multiple approaches, developmental stages and a growing number of species, enabling improvement and revision of the classification. This community-based strategy could serve as a common foundation for future detailed analysis and reverse engineering of cortical circuits and serve as an example for cell type classification in other parts of the nervous system and other organs.",

While foundation models have achieved significant success in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present ChromFound, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings, enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and GRN-based representations.",

While the field is still actively debating on the best practices, the challenge increased with the emergence of mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics and the dramatic increase in missing values. A popular approach to deal with missing values is to perform imputation. Imputation has several drawbacks for which alternatives exist, but currently imputation is still a practical solution widely adopted in single-cell proteomics data analysis. This perspective discusses the advantages and drawbacks of imputation. We also highlight 5 main challenges linked to missing value management in single-cell proteomics.

However, proteome heterogeneity is largely unexplored because of the limitations of existing methods for quantifying protein levels in single cells. To alleviate these limitations, we developed Single Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS), and validated its ability to identify distinct human cancer cell types based on their proteomes. We used SCoPE-MS to quantify over a thousand proteins in differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The single-cell proteomes enabled us to deconstruct cell populations and infer protein abundance relationships. Comparison between single-cell proteomes and transcriptomes indicated coordinated mRNA and protein covariation. Yet many genes exhibited functionally concerted and distinct regulatory patterns at the mRNA and the protein levels, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms contribute to proteome remodeling during lineage specification, especially for developmental genes. SCoPE-MS is broadly applicable to measuring proteome configurations of single cells and linking them to functional phenotypes, such as cell type and differentiation potentials.",

This granular perspective reveals distinct cell states, population heterogeneity, and the underpinnings of disease pathogenesis that bulk approaches may obscure. However, SCP demands exceptional sensitivity, precise cell handling, and robust data processing to overcome the inherent challenges of analyzing picogram-level protein samples without amplification. Recent innovations in sample preparation, separations, data acquisition strategies, and specialized mass spectrometry instrumentation have substantially improved proteome coverage and throughput. Approaches that integrate complementary omics, streamline multi-step sample processing, and automate workflows through microfluidics and specialized platforms promise to further push SCP boundaries. Advances in computational methods, especially for data normalization and imputation, address the pervasive issue of missing values, enabling more reliable downstream biological interpretations. Despite these strides, higher throughput, reproducibility, and consensus best practices remain pressing needs in the field.

In addition, we used a design containing cell lines mixed in known proportions to generate controlled variability for data analysis benchmarking. In this work, we provide a flexible data analysis protocol for SCP data using the scp package together with comprehensive explanations at each step of the processing. Our main steps are quality control on the feature and cell level, aggregation of the raw data into peptides and proteins, normalisation and batch correction.

These challenges have motivated corresponding solutions, including SCoPE-design multiplexing and clean, automated, and miniaturized sample preparation. Synergistically applied, these solutions enable quantifying thousands of proteins across many single cells and establish a solid foundation for further advances.

    "abstract": "An important problem in contemporary immunology studies based on single-cell protein expression data is to determine whether cellular expressions are remodeled post infection by a pathogen. One natural approach for detecting such changes is to use non-parametric two-sample statistical tests. However, in single-cell studies, direct application of these tests is often inadequate because single-cell level expression data from uninfected populations often contains attributes of several latent sub-populations with highly heterogeneous characteristics. As a result, viruses often infect these different sub-populations at different rates in which case the traditional nonparametric two-sample tests for checking similarity in distributions are no longer conservative. We propose a new nonparametric method for Testing Remodeling Under Heterogeneity (TRUH) that can accurately detect changes in the infected samples compared to possibly heterogeneous uninfected samples. Our testing framework is based on composite nulls and is designed to allow the null model to encompass the possibility that the infected samples, though unaltered by the virus, might be dominantly arising from under-represented sub-populations in the baseline data. The TRUH statistic, which uses nearest neighbor projections of the infected samples into the baseline uninfected population, is calibrated using a novel bootstrap algorithm. We demonstrate the non-asymptotic performance of the test via simulation experiments and derive the large sample limit of the test statistic, which provides theoretical support towards consistent asymptotic calibration of the test. We use the TRUH statistic for studying remodeling in tonsillar T cells under different types of HIV infection and find that unlike traditional tests, TRUH based statistical inference conforms to the biologically validated immunological theories on HIV infection.",

These studies hold great promise for finding co-targetable hub/pathways which in turn would control the downstream non-genetic mechanisms of adaptive resistance. Many such mechanisms have been described in the paradigmatic BRAF-mutated melanoma model of adaptive response to BRAF inhibition. Currently, a major challenge for these mechanistic studies is to confirm in vivo, at the single-cell proteomic level, the existence of dependencies between the co-targeted hub/pathways and their downstream effectors. Moreover, the drug-induced in vivo modulation of these dependencies needs to be demonstrated. Here, we implement such single-cell-based in vivo expression dependency quantification using immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based analyses of sequential biopsies in two xenograft models. These mimic phase 2 and 3 trials in our own therapeutic strategy to prevent the adaptive response to BRAF inhibition. In this mechanistic model, the dependencies between the targeted Li2CO3-inducible hub HuR and the resistance effectors are more likely time-shifted and transient since the minority of HuRLow cells, which act as a reservoir of adaptive plasticity, switch to a HuRHigh state as they paradoxically proliferate under BRAF inhibition. Nevertheless, we show that a copula/kernel density estimator (KDE)-based quantification of mutual information (MI) efficiently captures, at the individual level, the dependencies between HuR and two relevant resistance markers pERK and EGFR, and outperforms classic expression correlation coefficients. Ultimately, the validation of MI as a predictive IHC-based metric of response to our therapeutic strategy will be carried in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Molecular and genomic technological advancements have greatly enhanced our understanding of biological processes by allowing us to quantify key biological variables such as gene expression, protein levels, and microbiome compositions. These breakthroughs have enabled us to achieve increasingly higher levels of resolution in our measurements, exemplified by our ability to comprehensively profile biological information at the single-cell level. However, the analysis of such data faces several critical challenges: limited number of individuals, non-normality, potential dropouts, outliers, and repeated measurements from the same individual. In this article, we propose a novel method, which we call U-statistic based latent variable (ULV). Our proposed method takes advantage of the robustness of rank-based statistics and exploits the statistical efficiency of parametric methods for small sample sizes. It is a computationally feasible framework that addresses all the issues mentioned above simultaneously. An additional advantage of ULV is its flexibility in modeling various types of single-cell data, including both RNA and protein abundance. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated in two studies: a single-cell proteomics study of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and a single-cell RNA study of COVID-19 symptoms. In the AML study, ULV successfully identified differentially expressed proteins that would have been missed by the pseudobulk version of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. In the COVID-19 study, ULV identified genes associated with covariates such as age and gender, and genes that would be missed without adjusting for covariates. The differentially expressed genes identified by our method are less biased toward genes with high expression levels. Furthermore, ULV identified additional gene pathways likely contributing to the mechanisms of COVID-19 severity.",

    "abstract": "In analogy to the development of fluorescent proteins, innovative tools for screening optoacoustic cell labels could lead to tailored protein labels for OA, imparting novel ways to visualize biological structure and function. Optoacoustic imaging emerges towards a highly promising modality for life sciences and medical practise with advantageous capabilities such as great accessible depth, and 3D studying of living tissue. The development of novel labels with molecular specificity could significantly enhance the optoacoustic contrast, specificity, and sensitivity and allow optoacoustic to interrogate tissues not amenable to the fluorescence method. We report on an optoacoustic flow cytometer (OAFC) prototype, developed for screening optoacoustic reporter genes. The cytometer concurrently records light scattering for referencing purposes. Since recording light scattering is completely independent from OA, we believe it to be a more reliable referencing method than e.g. fluorescence or ultrasound-backscatter. Precise characterization of our OAFC prototype showcases its ability to optoacoustically characterize objects in-flow that are in the size range of single cells. We apply the OAFC to distinguish individual E. coli cells based on optoacoustic properties of their expressed chromoproteins read in-flow using microfluidic arrangements and achieved precisions over 90%. We discuss how the light scattering referenced OAFC method offers a critical step towards routine measurement of optoacoustic properties of single-cells and could pave the way for identifying genetically encoded optoacoustic reporters, by transferring working concepts of the fluorescence field.",

    "abstract": "Flow cytometry is a widespread single-cell measurement technology with a multitude of clinical and research applications. Interpretation of flow cytometry data is hard; the instrumentation is delicate and can not render absolute measurements, hence samples can only be interpreted in relation to each other while at the same time comparisons are confounded by inter-sample variation. Despite this, current automated flow cytometry data analysis methods either treat samples individually or ignore the variation by for example pooling the data. In this article we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model for studying latent relations between cell populations in flow cytometry samples, thereby systematizing inter-sample variation. The model is applied to a data set containing replicated flow cytometry measurements of samples from healthy individuals, with informative priors capturing expert knowledge. It is shown that the technical variation in the inferred cell population sizes is small in comparison to the intrinsic biological variation. The large size of flow cytometry data, where a single sample can contain measurements on hundreds of thousands of cells, necessitates computationally efficient methods. To address this, we have implemented a parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme for sampling the posterior distribution.",

    "abstract": "Increasing demand for understanding the vast heterogeneity of cellular phenotypes has driven the development of imaging flow cytometry (IFC), that combines features of flow cytometry with fluorescence and bright field microscopy. IFC combines the throughput and statistical advantage of flow cytometry with the ability to discretely measure events based on a real or computational image, as well as conventional flow cytometry metrics. A limitation of existing IFC systems is that, regardless of detection methodology, only two-dimensional (2D) cell images are obtained. Without tomographic three-dimensional (3D) resolution the projection problem remains: collapsing 3D information onto a 2D image, limiting the reliability of spot counting or co-localization crucial to cell phenotyping. Here we present a solution to the projection problem: three-dimensional imaging flow cytometry (3D-IFC), a high-throughput 3D cell imager based on optical sectioning microscopy. We combine orthogonal light-sheet scanning illumination with our previous spatiotemporal transformation detection to produce 3D cell image reconstruction from a cameraless single-pixel photodetector readout. We further demonstrate this capability by co-capturing 3D fluorescence and label-free side-scattering images of single cells in flow at a velocity of 0.2 m s-1, corresponding to a throughput of approximately 500 cells per second with 60,000 voxels (resized subsequently to 106 voxels) for each cell image at a resolution of less than 1 micron in X, Y, and Z dimensions. Improved high-throughput imaging tools are needed to phenotype-genotype recognized heterogeneity in the fields of immunology, oncology, cell- and gene- therapy, and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Flow cytometry mainly used for detecting the characteristics of a number of biochemical substances based on the expression of specific markers in cells. It is particularly useful for detecting membrane surface receptors, antigens, ions, or during DNA/RNA expression. Not only can it be employed as a biomedical research tool for recognising distinctive types of cells in mixed populations, but it can also be used as a diagnostic tool for classifying abnormal cell populations connected with disease. Modern flow cytometers can rapidly analyse tens of thousands of cells at the same time while also measuring multiple parameters from a single cell. However, the rapid development of flow cytometers makes it challenging for conventional analysis methods to interpret flow cytometry data. Researchers need to be able to distinguish interesting-looking cell populations manually in multi-dimensional data collected from millions of cells. Thus, it is essential to find a robust approach for analysing flow cytometry data automatically, specifically in identifying cell populations automatically. This thesis mainly concerns discover the potential shortcoming of current automated-gating algorithms in both real datasets and synthetic datasets. Three representative automated clustering algorithms are selected to be applied, compared and evaluated by completely and partially automated gating. A subspace clustering ProClus also implemented in this thesis. The performance of ProClus in flow cytometry is not well, but it is still a useful algorithm to detect noise.",

In this article, our aim is to exhibit the use of statistical analyses on the raw, uncompressed data thus improving replicability, and exposing multivariate patterns and their associated uncertainty profiles. We show that multivariate generative models are a valid alternative to univariate hypothesis testing. We propose two models: a multivariate Poisson log-normal mixed model and a logistic linear mixed model. We show that these models are complementary and that either model can account for different confounders. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to provide Bayesian uncertainty quantification.

FC employs high-throughput technologies and generates high-dimensional data, and hence algorithms for analyzing the data represent a bottleneck. This dissertation addresses several computational challenges arising in modern cytometry while mining information from high-dimensional and high-content biological data. A collection of combinatorial and statistical algorithms for locating, matching, prototyping, and classifying cellular populations from multi-parametric FC data is developed.   The algorithmic pipeline, flowMatch, developed in this dissertation consists of five well-defined algorithmic modules to (1) transform data to stabilize within-population variance, (2) identify cell populations by robust clustering algorithms, (3) register cell populations across samples, (4) encapsulate a class of samples with templates, and (5) classify samples based on their similarity with the templates. Components of flowMatch can work independently or collaborate with each other to perform the complete data analysis. flowMatch is made available as an open-source R package in Bioconductor.   We have employed flowMatch for classifying leukemia samples, evaluating the phosphorylation effects on T cells, classifying healthy immune profiles, and classifying the vaccination status of HIV patients. In these analyses, the pipeline is able to reach biologically meaningful conclusions quickly and efficiently with the automated algorithms. The algorithms included in flowMatch can also be applied to problems outside of flow cytometry such as in microarray data analysis and image recognition.

Boolean gating techniques coupled with comparisons of relative abundances of cellular subsets is the current standard for cytometry data analysis. However, this approach is unable to capture more subtle topological features hidden in data, especially if those features are further masked by data transforms or significant batch effects or donor-to-donor variations in clinical data. Analysis of publicly available cytometry data describing non-na\\\"ive CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls shows that systematic structural differences exist between single cell protein expressions in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. We identify proteins of interest by a decision-tree based classifier, sample points randomly and compute persistence diagrams from these sampled points. The resulting persistence diagrams identify regions in cytometry datasets of varying density and identify protruded structures such as `elbows'. We compute Wasserstein distances between these persistence diagrams for random pairs of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients and find that systematic structural differences exist between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in the expression data for T-bet, Eomes, and Ki-67. Further analysis shows that expression of T-bet and Eomes are significantly downregulated in COVID-19 patient non-na\\\"ive CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This counter-intuitive finding may indicate that canonical effector CD8+ T cells are less prevalent in COVID-19 patients than healthy controls. This method is applicable to any cytometry dataset for discovering novel insights through topological data analysis which may be difficult to ascertain otherwise with a standard gating strategy or existing bioinformatic tools.",

    "abstract": "Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context. However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach. Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices, pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability.

Our model allows one to flexibly estimate how cell properties and relative abundances depend on environmental covariates, without the computational burden of backpropagation. We show that the proposed model provides superior predictive performance in simulated examples compared to a mixture of linear experts.

    "abstract": "Flow cytometry is a high-throughput technology used to quantify multiple surface and intracellular markers at the level of a single cell. This enables to identify cell sub-types, and to determine their relative proportions. Improvements of this technology allow to describe millions of individual cells from a blood sample using multiple markers. This results in high-dimensional datasets, whose manual analysis is highly time-consuming and poorly reproducible. While several methods have been developed to perform automatic recognition of cell populations, most of them treat and analyze each sample independently. However, in practice, individual samples are rarely independent (e.g. longitudinal studies). Here, we propose to use a Bayesian nonparametric approach with Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) of multivariate skew $t$-distributions to perform model based clustering of flow-cytometry data. DPM models directly estimate the number of cell populations from the data, avoiding model selection issues, and skew $t$-distributions provides robustness to outliers and non-elliptical shape of cell populations. To accommodate repeated measurements, we propose a sequential strategy relying on a parametric approximation of the posterior. We illustrate the good performance of our method on simulated data, on an experimental benchmark dataset, and on new longitudinal data from the DALIA-1 trial which evaluates a therapeutic vaccine against HIV. On the benchmark dataset, the sequential strategy outperforms all other methods evaluated, and similarly, leads to improved performance on the DALIA-1 data.

While modern experiments often necessitate the collection and processing of samples in multiple batches, analysis of FCM data across batches is challenging because differences across samples may occur due to either true biological variation or technical reasons such as antibody lot effects or instrument optics across batches. Thus a critical step in comparative analyses of multi-sample FCM data---yet missing in existing automated methods for analyzing such data---is cross-sample calibration, whose goal is to align corresponding cell subsets across multiple samples in the presence of technical variations, so that biological variations can be meaningfully compared. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical modeling approach for accomplishing both calibration and cell classification simultaneously in a unified probabilistic manner. Three important features of our method make it particularly effective for analyzing multi-sample FCM data: a nonparametric mixture avoids prespecifying the number of cell clusters; a hierarchical skew normal kernel that allows flexibility in the shapes of the cell subsets and cross-sample variation in their locations; and finally the \"coarsening\" strategy makes inference robust to departures from the model such as heavy-tailness not captured by the skew normal kernels. We demonstrate the merits of our approach in simulated examples and carry out a case study in the analysis of two multi-sample FCM data sets.",

    "title": "TEAM: A Multiple Testing Algorithm on the Aggregation Tree for Flow   Cytometry Analysis",
    "abstract": "In immunology studies, flow cytometry is a commonly used multivariate single-cell assay. One key goal in flow cytometry analysis is to pinpoint the immune cells responsive to certain stimuli. Statistically, this problem can be translated into comparing two protein expression probability density functions (PDFs) before and after the stimulus; the goal is to pinpoint the regions where these two pdfs differ. In this paper, we model this comparison as a multiple testing problem. First, we partition the sample space into small bins. In each bin we form a hypothesis to test the existence of differential pdfs. Second, we develop a novel multiple testing method, called TEAM (Testing on the Aggregation tree Method), to identify those bins that harbor differential pdfs while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) under the desired level. TEAM embeds the testing procedure into an aggregation tree to test from fine- to coarse-resolution. The procedure achieves the statistical goal of pinpointing differential pdfs to the smallest possible regions. TEAM is computationally efficient, capable of analyzing large flow cytometry data sets in much shorter time compared with competing methods. We applied TEAM and competing methods on a flow cytometry data set to identify T cells responsive to the cytomeglovirus (CMV)-pp65 antigen stimulation. TEAM successfully identified the monofunctional, bifunctional, and polyfunctional T cells while the competing methods either did not finish in a reasonable time frame or provided less interpretable results. Numerical simulations and theoretical justifications demonstrate that TEAM has asymptotically valid, powerful, and robust performance. Overall, TEAM is a computationally efficient and statistically powerful algorithm that can yield meaningful biological insights in flow cytometry studies.",

    "abstract": "Blu-ray drive is an engineering masterpiece that integrates disc rotation, pickup head translation, and three lasers in a compact and portable format. Here we integrate a blood-coated image sensor with a modified Blu-ray drive for high-throughput cytometric analysis of various bio-specimens. In this device, samples are mounted on the rotating Blu-ray disc and illuminated by the built-in lasers from the pickup head. The resulting coherent diffraction patterns are then recorded by the blood-coated image sensor. The rich spatial features of the blood-cell monolayer help down-modulate the object information for sensor detection, thus forming a high-resolution computational bio-lens with a theoretically unlimited field of view. With the acquired data, we develop a lensless coherent diffraction imaging modality termed rotational ptychography for image reconstruction. We show that our device can resolve the 435 nm linewidth on the resolution target and has a field of view only limited by the size of the Blu-ray disc. To demonstrate its applications, we perform high-throughput urinalysis by locating disease-related calcium oxalate crystals over the entire microscope slide. We also quantify different types of cells on a blood smear with an acquisition speed of ~10,000 cells per second. For in vitro experiment, we monitor live bacterial cultures over the entire Petri dish with single-cell resolution. Using biological cells as a computational lens could enable new intriguing imaging devices for point-of-care diagnostics. Modifying a Blu-ray drive with the blood-coated sensor further allows the spread of high-throughput optical microscopy from well-equipped laboratories to citizen scientists worldwide.",

    "abstract": "In situ measurement of cellular metabolites is still a challenge in biology. Conventional methods, such as mass spectrometry or fluorescence microscopy, would either destruct the sample or introduce strong perturbations to the functions of target molecules. Here, we present multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging cytometry as a label-free single-cell analysis platform with chemical specifity, and high-throughput capabilities. Cellular compartments such as lipid droplets, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei are seperated from the cytoplasm. Based on these chemical segmentations, 260 features from both morphology and molecular composition were generated and analyzed for each cell. Using SRS imaging cytometry, we studied the metabolic responses of human pancreatic cancer cells under stress by starvation and chemotherapy drug treatments. We unveiled lipid-facilitated protrusion as a metabolic marker for stress-resistant cancer cells through statistical analysis of thousands of cells. Our findings also demonstrate the potential of targeting lipid metabolism for selective treatment of starvation-resistant and chemotherapy-resistant cancers. These results highlight our SRS imaging cytometry as a powerful label-free tool for biological discoveries with a high-throughput, high-content capacity.",

    "title": "A Bayesian Feature Allocation Model for Identification of Cell   Subpopulations Using Cytometry Data",
    "abstract": "A Bayesian feature allocation model (FAM) is presented for identifying cell subpopulations based on multiple samples of cell surface or intracellular marker expression level data obtained by cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Cell subpopulations are characterized by differences in expression patterns of makers, and individual cells are clustered into the subpopulations based on the patterns of their observed expression levels. A finite Indian buffet process is used to model subpopulations as latent features, and a model-based method based on these latent feature subpopulations is used to construct cell clusters within each sample. Non-ignorable missing data due to technical artifacts in mass cytometry instruments are accounted for by defining a static missing data mechanism. In contrast to conventional cell clustering methods based on observed marker expression levels that are applied separately to different samples, the FAM based method can be applied simultaneously to multiple samples, and can identify important cell subpopulations likely to be missed by conventional clustering. The proposed FAM based method is applied to jointly analyze three datasets, generated by CyTOF, to study natural killer (NK) cells. Because the subpopulations identified by the FAM may define novel NK cell subsets, this statistical analysis may provide useful information about the biology of NK cells and their potential role in cancer immunotherapy which may lead, in turn, to development of improved cellular therapies. Simulation studies of the proposed method's behavior under two cases of known subpopulations also are presented, followed by analysis of the CyTOF NK cell surface marker data.",

We also introduce alpha-clustering, which recommends the optimal cluster assignment, without foreknowledge of the number of clusters, based off of the cluster stability across multiple scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of tree-SNE and alpha-clustering on images of handwritten digits, mass cytometry (CyTOF) data from blood cells, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from retinal cells. Furthermore, to demonstrate the validity of the visualization, we use alpha-clustering to obtain unsupervised clustering results competitive with the state of the art on several image data sets.
