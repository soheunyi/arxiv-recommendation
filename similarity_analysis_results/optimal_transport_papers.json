    "abstract": "We propose an extension of the computational fluid mechanics approach to the Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem, which was developed by Benamou-Brenier. Our extension allows optimal transfer of unnormalized and unequal masses. We obtain a one-parameter family of simple modifications of the formulation in [4]. This leads us to a new Monge-Ampere type equation and a new Kantorovich duality formula. These can be solved efficiently by, for example, the Chambolle-Pock primal-dual algorithm. This solution to the extended mass transfer problem gives us a simple metric for computing the distance between two unnormalized densities. The L1 version of this metric was shown in [23] (which is a precursor of our work here) to have desirable properties.",

    "abstract": "An adaptive, adversarial methodology is developed for the optimal transport problem between two distributions $\\mu$ and $\\nu$, known only through a finite set of independent samples $(x_i)_{i=1..N}$ and $(y_j)_{j=1..M}$. The methodology automatically creates features that adapt to the data, thus avoiding reliance on a priori knowledge of data distribution. Specifically, instead of a discrete point-bypoint assignment, the new procedure seeks an optimal map $T(x)$ defined for all $x$, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between $(T(xi))$ and the target $(y_j)$. The relative entropy is given a sample-based, variational characterization, thereby creating an adversarial setting: as one player seeks to push forward one distribution to the other, the second player develops features that focus on those areas where the two distributions fail to match. The procedure solves local problems matching consecutive, intermediate distributions between $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. As a result, maps of arbitrary complexity can be built by composing the simple maps used for each local problem. Displaced interpolation is used to guarantee global from local optimality. The procedure is illustrated through synthetic examples in one and two dimensions.",

However, many applications impose elementwise constraints on the transport plan which traditional optimal transport cannot enforce. Here we introduce Supervised Optimal Transport (sOT) that formulates a constrained optimal transport problem where couplings between certain elements are prohibited according to specific applications. sOT is proved to be equivalent to an $l^1$ penalized optimization problem, from which efficient algorithms are designed to solve its entropy regularized formulation. We demonstrate the capability of sOT by comparing it to other variants and extensions of traditional OT in color transfer problem. We also study the barycenter problem in sOT formulation, where we discover and prove a unique reverse and portion selection (control) mechanism. Supervised optimal transport is broadly applicable to applications in which constrained transport plan is involved and the original unit should be preserved by avoiding normalization.",

The algorithm is based on a recently introduced variational formulation of the Bayes' rule, which aims to find the Brenier optimal transport map between the prior and the posterior distributions as the solution to a stochastic optimization problem. On the theoretical side, the existing methods for the error analysis of particle filters and stability results for optimal transport map estimation are combined to obtain uniform error bounds for the filter's performance in terms of the optimization gap in solving the variational problem. The error analysis reveals a bias-variance trade-off that can ultimately be used to understand if/when the curse of dimensionality can be avoided in these filters. On the computational side, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a nonlinear filtering example in comparison with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle filter.",

Its descendant metric, the Wasserstein distance, has been particularly successful in measuring distribution dissimilarities. While extensive research has focused on optimal transport and its regularized variants (such as entropy, sparsity, and capacity constraints) the role of time has been largely overlooked. However, time is a critical factor in real world transport problems.   In this work, we introduce a time parameterized formulation of the optimal transport problem, incorporating a time variable t to represent sequential steps and enforcing specific constraints at each step.

However, its inability to produce transport plans limits its practical use to applications where only a distance is necessary. Several heuristics have been proposed in the recent years to address this limitation when the probability measures are discrete. In this paper, we propose to study these different propositions by redefining and analysing them rigorously for generic probability measures. Leveraging the $\\nu$-based Wasserstein distance and generalised geodesics, we introduce and study the Pivot Sliced Discrepancy, inspired by a recent work by Mahey et al.. We demonstrate its semi-metric properties and its relation to a constrained Kantorovich formulation. In the same way, we generalise and study the recent Expected Sliced plans introduced by Liu et al. for completely generic measures.

In this chapter, we investigate the limiting process for arbitrary measures on compact sets and Lipschitz continuous cost functions. In particular, we are interested in the behavior of the corresponding optimal potentials $\\hat \\varphi_\\varepsilon$, $\\hat \\psi_\\varepsilon$ and $\\hat \\varphi_K$ appearing in the dual formulation of the Sinkhorn divergences and discrepancies, respectively. While part of the results are known, we provide rigorous proofs for some relations which we have not found in this generality in the literature.

However, it is often desirable that the marginals of the optimal transport plan do not match the given measures exactly, which led to the introduction of the so-called unbalanced optimal transport. Since unbalanced methods were not examined for the multi-marginal setting so far, we address this topic in the present paper. More precisely, we introduce the unbalanced multi-marginal optimal transport problem and its dual, and show that a unique optimal transport plan exists under mild assumptions. Further, we generalize the Sinkhorn algorithm for regularized unbalanced optimal transport to the multi-marginal setting and prove its convergence. If the cost function decouples according to a tree, the iterates can be computed efficiently. At the end, we discuss three applications of our framework, namely two barycenter problems and a transfer operator approach, where we establish a relation between the barycenter problem and the multi-marginal optimal transport with an appropriate tree-structured cost function.",

The high-order constraints in sGW are transferred to constraints on the coupling matrix by solving a minimal vertex cover problem. The transformed problem is solved by the Mirror-C descent iteration coupled with the supervised optimal transport solver. In the numerical experiments, we first validate the proposed framework by applying it to matching synthetic datasets and investigating the impact of the model parameters. Additionally, we successfully apply sGW to real single-cell RNA sequencing data.

    "abstract": "Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT), also referred to as the Schr\\\"odinger problem, seeks to find a random processes with prescribed initial/final marginals and with minimal relative entropy with respect to a reference measure. The relative entropy forces the two measures to share the same support and only the drift of the controlled process can be adjusted, the diffusion being imposed by the reference measure. Therefore, at first sight, Semi-Martingale Optimal Transport (SMOT) problems (see [1]) seem out of the scope of applications of Entropic regularization techniques, which are otherwise very attractive from a computational point of view. However, when the process is observed only at discrete times, and become therefore a Markov chain, its relative entropy can remain finite even with variable diffusion coefficients, and discrete semi-martingales can be obtained as solutions of (multi-marginal) EOT problems.Given a (smooth) semi-martingale, the limit of the relative entropy of its time discretizations, scaled by the time step converges to the so-called ``specific relative entropy'', a convex functional of its variance process, similar to those used in SMOT.In this paper we use this observation to build an entropic time discretization of continuous SMOT problems. This allows to compute discrete approximations of solutions to continuous SMOT problems by a multi-marginal Sinkhorn algorithm, without the need of solving the non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman pde's associated to the dual problem, as done for example in [1, 2]. We prove a convergence result of the time discrete entropic problem to the continuous time problem, we propose an implementation and provide numerical experiments supporting the theoretical convergence.",

    "title": "Inverse optimal transport",
    "abstract": "Discrete optimal transportation problems arise in various contexts in engineering, the sciences and the social sciences. Often the underlying cost criterion is unknown, or only partly known, and the observed optimal solutions are corrupted by noise. In this paper we propose a systematic approach to infer unknown costs from noisy observations of optimal transportation plans. The algorithm requires only the ability to solve the forward optimal transport problem, which is a linear program, and to generate random numbers. It has a Bayesian interpretation, and may also be viewed as a form of stochastic optimization.   We illustrate the developed methodologies using the example of international migration flows. Reported migration flow data captures (noisily) the number of individuals moving from one country to another in a given period of time. It can be interpreted as a noisy observation of an optimal transportation map, with costs related to the geographical position of countries. We use a graph-based formulation of the problem, with countries at the nodes of graphs and non-zero weighted adjacencies only on edges between countries which share a border. We use the proposed algorithm to estimate the weights, which represent cost of transition, and to quantify uncertainty in these weights.",

    "title": "Quantum Optimal Transport",
    "abstract": "We analyze a quantum version of the Monge--Kantorovich optimal transport problem. The quantum transport cost related to a Hermitian cost matrix $C$ is minimized over the set of all bipartite coupling states $\\rho^{AB}$ with fixed reduced density matrices $\\rho^A$ and $\\rho^B$ of size $m$ and $n$. The minimum quantum optimal transport cost $\\rT^Q_{C}(\\rho^A,\\rho^B)$ can be efficiently computed using semidefinite programming. In the case $m=n$ the cost $\\rT^Q_{C}$ gives a semidistance if and only if $C$ is positive semidefinite and vanishes exactly on the subspace of symmetric matrices. Furthermore, if $C$ satisfies the above conditions, then $\\sqrt{\\rT^Q_{C}}$ induces a quantum analogue of the Wasserstein-2 distance. Taking the quantum cost matrix $C^Q$ to be the projector on the antisymmetric subspace, we provide a semi-analytic expression for $\\rT^Q_{C^Q}$ for any pair of single-qubit states and show that its square root yields a transport distance on the Bloch ball. Numerical simulations suggest that this property holds also in higher dimensions. Assuming that the cost matrix suffers decoherence and that the density matrices become diagonal, we study the quantum-to-classical transition of the Earth mover's distance, propose a continuous family of interpolating distances, and demonstrate that the quantum transport is cheaper than the classical one. Furthermore, we introduce a related quantity -- the SWAP-fidelity -- and compare its properties with the standard Uhlmann--Jozsa fidelity. We also discuss the quantum optimal transport for general $d$-partite systems.",

    "abstract": "Optimal transport (OT) is a powerful framework to compare probability measures, a fundamental task in many statistical and machine learning problems. Substantial advances have been made in designing OT variants which are either computationally and statistically more efficient or robust. Among them, sliced OT distances have been extensively used to mitigate optimal transport's cubic algorithmic complexity and curse of dimensionality. In parallel, unbalanced OT was designed to allow comparisons of more general positive measures, while being more robust to outliers. In this paper, we bridge the gap between those two concepts and develop a general framework for efficiently comparing positive measures. We notably formulate two different versions of sliced unbalanced OT, and study the associated topology and statistical properties. We then develop a GPU-friendly Frank-Wolfe like algorithm to compute the corresponding loss functions, and show that the resulting methodology is modular as it encompasses and extends prior related work. We finally conduct an empirical analysis of our loss functions and methodology on both synthetic and real datasets, to illustrate their computational efficiency, relevance and applicability to real-world scenarios including geophysical data.",

We thus focus on supermodular costs (or submodular rewards) and introduce a coupling $P_{*}$ that is optimal for all such costs and yields the sharp bound. This coupling admits manifold characterizations -- geometric, order-theoretic, as optimal transport, through the cdf, and via the transport kernel -- that explain its structure and imply useful bounds.

    "abstract": "This article introduces a generalization of the discrete optimal transport, with applications to color image manipulations. This new formulation includes a relaxation of the mass conservation constraint and a regularization term. These two features are crucial for image processing tasks, which necessitate to take into account families of multimodal histograms, with large mass variation across modes.   The corresponding relaxed and regularized transportation problem is the solution of a convex optimization problem. Depending on the regularization used, this minimization can be solved using standard linear programming methods or first order proximal splitting schemes.   The resulting transportation plan can be used as a color transfer map, which is robust to mass variation across images color palettes. Furthermore, the regularization of the transport plan helps to remove colorization artifacts due to noise amplification.   We also extend this framework to the computation of barycenters of distributions. The barycenter is the solution of an optimization problem, which is separately convex with respect to the barycenter and the transportation plans, but not jointly convex. A block coordinate descent scheme converges to a stationary point of the energy. We show that the resulting algorithm can be used for color normalization across several images. The relaxed and regularized barycenter defines a common color palette for those images. Applying color transfer toward this average palette performs a color normalization of the input images.",

We derive the dual problem and show strong duality and existence of primal and dual solutions to the regularized problem. Then we derive two algorithms to solve the dual problem of the regularized problem: A Gauss-Seidel method and a semismooth quasi-Newton method and investigate both methods numerically. Our experiments show that the methods perform well even for small regularization parameters. Quadratic regularization is of interest since the resulting optimal transport plans are sparse, i.e. they have a small support (which is not the case for the often used entropic regularization where the optimal transport plan always has full measure).",

In order to make it as self-contained as possible I included an appendix with some basic definitions and results. I believe that any graduate student in mathematics, as well as advanced undergraduate students, can read and understand this book. Some chapters (in particular in Parts II\\&III ) can also be interesting for experts. Starting with the the most fundamental, fully discrete problem I attempted to place optimal transport as a particular case of the celebrated stable marriage problem. From there we proceed to the partition problem, which can be formulated as a transport from a continuous space to a discrete one. Applications to information theory and game theory (cooperative and non-cooperative) are introduced as well.   Finally, the general case of transport between two compact measure spaces is introduced as a coupling between two semi-discrete transports.",

The proximal operator associated with the proximal optimal transport divergence can be interpreted as a transport map that pushes a reference distribution toward the optimal generative distribution, which approximates the target distribution that is only accessible through data samples. Building on the Benamou-Brenier dynamic formulation of classical optimal transport, we also establish a dynamic formulation for proximal OT divergences. The resulting dynamic formulation is a first order mean-field game whose optimality conditions are governed by a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations: a backward Hamilton-Jacobi equation and a forward continuity equation.

In the multi-objective problem, the notion of Pareto efficiency is defined in terms of the objectives together with non-negativity constraints and with equality constraints that are specified in terms of column sums. A second set of equality constraints, defined in terms of row sums, is used to single out particular points in the Pareto efficient set which are referred to as \"balanced solutions\". Examples from several fields are shown in which this solution concept appears naturally. Balanced solutions are shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with solutions of optimal transport problems. As an example of the use of alternative interpretations, the computation of solutions via regularization is discussed.",

This class of unbalanced transport metrics allows for transport between measures of different total mass, unlike classical optimal transport where both measures must have the same total mass. In particular, we develop the theory for the important subclass of semi-discrete unbalanced transport problems, where one of the measures is diffuse (absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure) and the other is discrete (a sum of Dirac masses). We characterize the optimal solutions and show they can be written in terms of generalized Laguerre diagrams. We use this to develop an efficient method for solving the semi-discrete unbalanced transport problem numerically. As an application we study the unbalanced quantization problem, where one looks for the best approximation of a diffuse measure by a discrete measure with respect to an unbalanced transport metric. We prove a type of crystallization result in two dimensions -- optimality of a locally triangular lattice with spatially varying density -- and compute the asymptotic quantization error as the number of Dirac masses tends to infinity.",

A linear programming duality theorem for this problem was first established by Levin. In this note, we prove under mild assumptions on the given data, the existence of a pair of $L^1$-functions optimizing the dual problem. Using these functions, which can be viewed as Lagrange multipliers to the marginal constraints $f$ and $g$, we characterize the solution $h$ of the primal problem. We expect these potentials to play a key role in any further analysis of $h$.   Moreover, starting from Levin's duality, we derive the classical Kantorovich duality for unconstrained optimal transport. In tandem with results obtained in our companion paper (arXiv:1309.3022), this amounts to a new and elementary proof of Kantorovich's duality.",

We first analyze the regularized problem in the context of classical Fenchel duality and derive a strong duality result for a predual problem in the space of continuous functions. However, this problem may not admit a minimizer, which prevents obtaining primal-dual optimality conditions. We then show that the primal problem is naturally analyzed in the Orlicz space of functions with finite entropy in the sense that the entropically regularized problem admits a minimizer if and only if the marginals have finite entropy. We then derive a dual problem in the corresponding dual space, for which existence can be shown by purely variational arguments and primal-dual optimality conditions can be derived. For marginals that do not have finite entropy, we finally show Gamma-convergence of the regularized problem with smoothed marginals to the original Kantorovich problem.",

These distances are defined by two equivalent alternative formulations: (i) a dynamic formulation defining the distance as a geodesic distance over the space of measures (ii) a static \"Kantorovich\" formulation where the distance is the minimum of an optimization problem over pairs of couplings describing the transfer (transport, creation and destruction) of mass between two measures. Both formulations are convex optimization problems, and the ability to switch from one to the other depending on the targeted application is a crucial property of our models. Of particular interest is the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric recently introduced independently by Chizat et al. and Kondratyev et al. Defined initially through a dynamic formulation, it belongs to this class of metrics and hence automatically benefits from a static Kantorovich formulation.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the limitations of standard uncertainty models, e.g., robust (norm-bounded) and stochastic (one fixed distribution, e.g., Gaussian), and proposes to model uncertainty via Optimal Transport (OT) ambiguity sets. These constitute a very rich uncertainty model, which enjoys many desirable geometrical, statistical, and computational properties, and which: (1) naturally generalizes both robust and stochastic models, and (2) captures many additional real-world uncertainty phenomena (e.g., black swan events). Our contributions show that OT ambiguity sets are also analytically tractable: they propagate easily and intuitively through linear and nonlinear (possibly corrupted by noise) transformations, and the result of the propagation is again an OT ambiguity set or can be tightly upper bounded by an OT ambiguity set. In the context of dynamical systems, our results allow us to consider multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g., initial condition, additive noise, multiplicative noise) and to capture in closed-form, via an OT ambiguity set, the resulting uncertainty in the state at any future time. Our results are actionable, interpretable, and readily employable in a great variety of computationally tractable control and estimation formulations. To highlight this, we study three applications in trajectory planning, consensus algorithms, and least squares estimation. We conclude the paper with a list of exciting open problems enabled by our results.",

    "abstract": "This paper concerns the application of techniques from optimal transport (OT) to mean field control, in which the probability measures of interest in OT correspond to empirical distributions associated with a large collection of controlled agents. The control objective of interest motivates a one-sided relaxation of OT, in which the first marginal is fixed and the second marginal is constrained to a moment class: a set of probability measures defined by generalized moment constraints. This relaxation is particularly interesting for control problems as it enables the coordination of agents without the need to know the desired distribution beforehand. The inclusion of an entropic regularizer is motivated by both computational considerations, and also to impose hard constraints on agent behavior. A computational approach inspired by the Sinkhorn algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. This new approach to distributed control is illustrated with an application of charging a fleet of electric vehicles while satisfying grid constraints. An online version is proposed and applied in a case study on the ElaadNL dataset containing 10,000 EV charging transactions in the Netherlands. This empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach to optimizing flexibility while respecting grid constraints.",

We derive several reformulations of the two regularised problems and in particular introduce the idea of a regularised induced marginal perspective cost function allowing us to derive an extended space formulation of the original space regularisation. We also prove convergence to the unregularised problem in the case of the extended space regularisation and discuss on-going work on deriving a unified framework based on higher order liftings in which both regularisations can be directly compared.

    "abstract": "To remedy the drawbacks of full-mass or fixed-mass constraints in classical optimal transport, we propose adaptive optimal transport which is distinctive from the classical optimal transport in its ability of adaptive-mass preserving. It aims to answer the mathematical problem of how to transport the probability mass adaptively between probability distributions, which is a fundamental topic in various areas of artificial intelligence. Adaptive optimal transport is able to transfer mass adaptively in the light of the intrinsic structure of the problem itself. The theoretical results shed light on the adaptive mechanism of mass transportation. Furthermore, we instantiate the adaptive optimal transport in machine learning application to align source and target distributions partially and adaptively by respecting the ubiquity of noises, outliers, and distribution shifts in the data. The experiment results on the domain adaptation benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Optimal transport provides a metric which quantifies the dissimilarity between probability measures. For measures supported in discrete metric spaces, finding the optimal transport distance has cubic time complexity in the size of the space. However, measures supported on trees admit a closed-form optimal transport that can be computed in linear time. In this paper, we aim to find an optimal tree structure for a given discrete metric space so that the tree-Wasserstein distance approximates the optimal transport distance in the original space. One of our key ideas is to cast the problem in ultrametric spaces. This helps us optimize over the space of ultrametric trees -- a mixed-discrete and continuous optimization problem -- via projected gradient decent over the space of ultrametric matrices. During optimization, we project the parameters to the ultrametric space via a hierarchical minimum spanning tree algorithm, equivalent to the closest projection to ultrametrics under the supremum norm. Experimental results on real datasets show that our approach outperforms previous approaches (e.g. Flowtree, Quadtree) in approximating optimal transport distances. Finally, experiments on synthetic data generated on ground truth trees show that our algorithm can accurately uncover the underlying trees.",

In this work, we explore the direction of replacing the Kullback-Leibler divergence with a novel Optimal transport-based regularization. By using the Sinkhorn mapping, we can approximate the Optimal transport distance between the state distribution of tasks. The distance is then used as an amortized reward to regularize the amount of sharing information.

    "abstract": "Recently, the pretrain-finetuning paradigm has attracted tons of attention in graph learning community due to its power of alleviating the lack of labels problem in many real-world applications. Current studies use existing techniques, such as weight constraint, representation constraint, which are derived from images or text data, to transfer the invariant knowledge from the pre-train stage to fine-tuning stage. However, these methods failed to preserve invariances from graph structure and Graph Neural Network (GNN) style models. In this paper, we present a novel optimal transport-based fine-tuning framework called GTOT-Tuning, namely, Graph Topology induced Optimal Transport fine-Tuning, for GNN style backbones. GTOT-Tuning is required to utilize the property of graph data to enhance the preservation of representation produced by fine-tuned networks. Toward this goal, we formulate graph local knowledge transfer as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem with a structural prior and construct the GTOT regularizer to constrain the fine-tuned model behaviors. By using the adjacency relationship amongst nodes, the GTOT regularizer achieves node-level optimal transport procedures and reduces redundant transport procedures, resulting in efficient knowledge transfer from the pre-trained models. We evaluate GTOT-Tuning on eight downstream tasks with various GNN backbones and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance for GNNs.",

In this paper, we address this issue for quadratic-cost transport -- specifically, computation of the Wasserstein-2 distance, a commonly-used formulation of optimal transport in machine learning. To overcome the challenge of computing ground truth transport maps between continuous measures needed to assess these solvers, we use input-convex neural networks (ICNN) to construct pairs of measures whose ground truth OT maps can be obtained analytically. This strategy yields pairs of continuous benchmark measures in high-dimensional spaces such as spaces of images. We thoroughly evaluate existing optimal transport solvers using these benchmark measures. Even though these solvers perform well in downstream tasks, many do not faithfully recover optimal transport maps. To investigate the cause of this discrepancy, we further test the solvers in a setting of image generation. Our study reveals crucial limitations of existing solvers and shows that increased OT accuracy does not necessarily correlate to better results downstream.",

It is particularly well-suited for point sets that are in high-dimensions, but are close to being intrinsically low-dimensional. The approach is based on an adaptive multiscale decomposition of the point sets. The multiscale decomposition yields a sequence of optimal transport problems, that are solved in a top-to-bottom fashion from the coarsest to the finest scale. We provide numerical evidence that this multiscale approach scales approximately linearly, in time and memory, in the number of nodes, instead of quadratically or worse for a direct solution. Empirically, the multiscale approach results in less than one percent relative error in the objective function. Furthermore, the multiscale plans constructed are of interest by themselves as they may be used to introduce novel features and notions of distances between point sets. An analysis of sets of brain MRI based on optimal transport distances illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on a real world data set. The application demonstrates that multiscale optimal transport distances have the potential to improve on state-of-the-art metrics currently used in computational anatomy.",

Further, we ensure that the flow follows the geometry by operating in the latent space of an autoencoder that we call a geodesic autoencoder (GAE). In GAE the latent space distance between points is regularized to match a novel multiscale geodesic distance on the data manifold that we define.

    "title": "Accelerating 3D Molecule Generation via Jointly Geometric Optimal   Transport",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new 3D molecule generation framework, called GOAT, for fast and effective 3D molecule generation based on the flow-matching optimal transport objective. Specifically, we formulate a geometric transport formula for measuring the cost of mapping multi-modal features (e.g., continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types) between a base distribution and a target data distribution. Our formula is solved within a joint, equivariant, and smooth representation space. This is achieved by transforming the multi-modal features into a continuous latent space with equivariant networks. In addition, we find that identifying optimal distributional coupling is necessary for fast and effective transport between any two distributions. We further propose a mechanism for estimating and purifying optimal coupling to train the flow model with optimal transport. By doing so, GOAT can turn arbitrary distribution couplings into new deterministic couplings, leading to an estimated optimal transport plan for fast 3D molecule generation. The purification filters out the subpar molecules to ensure the ultimate generation quality. We theoretically and empirically prove that the proposed optimal coupling estimation and purification yield transport plan with non-increasing cost. Finally, extensive experiments show that GOAT enjoys the efficiency of solving geometric optimal transport, leading to a double speedup compared to the sub-optimal method while achieving the best generation quality regarding validity, uniqueness, and novelty.

    "abstract": "Optimal Transport (OT) naturally arises in many machine learning applications, yet the heavy computational burden limits its wide-spread uses. To address the scalability issue, we propose an implicit generative learning-based framework called SPOT (Scalable Push-forward of Optimal Transport). Specifically, we approximate the optimal transport plan by a pushforward of a reference distribution, and cast the optimal transport problem into a minimax problem. We then can solve OT problems efficiently using primal dual stochastic gradient-type algorithms. We also show that we can recover the density of the optimal transport plan using neural ordinary differential equations. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate that SPOT is robust and has favorable convergence behavior. SPOT also allows us to efficiently sample from the optimal transport plan, which benefits downstream applications such as domain adaptation.",

In this paper, we show that an extension of the latter to tempered exponential measures, a generalization of exponential families with indirect measure normalization, gets to a very convenient middle ground, with both very fast approximation algorithms and sparsity, which is under control up to sparsity patterns. In addition, our formulation fits naturally in the unbalanced optimal transport problem setting.",

In addition, an initial partitioning algorithm is designed to improve the quality of k-way hypergraph partitioning. By assigning vertex weights through the LPT algorithm, we generate a prior hypergraph under a relaxed balance constraint. With the prior hypergraph, we have defined the Wasserstein discrepancy to coordinate the optimal transport of coarsening process. And the optimal transport matrix is solved by Sinkhorn algorithm. Our coarsening scheme fully takes into account the minimization of connectivity metric (objective function). For the initial partitioning stage, we define a normalized cut function induced by Fiedler vector, which is theoretically proved to be a concave function. Thereby, a three-point algorithm is designed to find the best cut under the balance constraint.",

    "abstract": "Optimal transport (OT) naturally arises in a wide range of machine learning applications but may often become the computational bottleneck. Recently, one line of works propose to solve OT approximately by searching the \\emph{transport plan} in a low-rank subspace. However, the optimal transport plan is often not low-rank, which tends to yield large approximation errors. For example, when Monge's \\emph{transport map} exists, the transport plan is full rank. This paper concerns the computation of the OT distance with adequate accuracy and efficiency. A novel approximation for OT is proposed, in which the transport plan can be decomposed into the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse one. We theoretically analyze the approximation error. An augmented Lagrangian method is then designed to efficiently calculate the transport plan.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of large datasets, offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising framework for learning good decision-making policies without the need to interact with the real environment. However, offline RL requires the dataset to be reward-annotated, which presents practical challenges when reward engineering is difficult or when obtaining reward annotations is labor-intensive. In this paper, we introduce Optimal Transport Reward labeling (OTR), an algorithm that assigns rewards to offline trajectories, with a few high-quality demonstrations. OTR's key idea is to use optimal transport to compute an optimal alignment between an unlabeled trajectory in the dataset and an expert demonstration to obtain a similarity measure that can be interpreted as a reward, which can then be used by an offline RL algorithm to learn the policy. OTR is easy to implement and computationally efficient. On D4RL benchmarks, we show that OTR with a single demonstration can consistently match the performance of offline RL with ground-truth rewards.",

However, it suffers from unavoidable quadratic time complexity when the optimal alignment matrix needs to be computed exactly. This hinders its use in deep learning architectures, where layers involving DTW computations cause severe bottlenecks. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a new metric for time series data based on the Optimal Transport (OT) framework, called Optimal Transport Warping (OTW). OTW enjoys linear time/space complexity, is differentiable and can be parallelized. OTW enjoys a moderate sensitivity to time and shape distortions, making it ideal for time series. We show the efficacy and efficiency of OTW on 1-Nearest Neighbor Classification and Hierarchical Clustering, as well as in the case of using OTW instead of DTW in Deep Learning architectures.",
